## Some improvements over the subject

- Evaluation of the expression can be done without using the `= ?` syntax
- Implicit multiplication has a higher precedence than every other operators (2x^3 is not equivalent to 2*x^3!)

## Bonus

- Support for constants:
	- `e`
	- `nan`
	- `pi`
	- `tau`
- Support for built-in functions:
	- `abs`
	- `cos`
	- `exp`
	- `log`
	- `sin`
	- `sqrt`
	- `tan`
- Functions with multiple arguments
- Built-in commands
- Matrix inversion
- Commands history
- Auto-completion
- Support for digits and underscores in function and variable names
