# This file shows how Computor v2 deals with function dependencies

# This is a simple function that returns the square of a number
f(x) = x^2

# This function uses the previous one
g(x) = f(x) + 1

# This function uses the previous one
h(x) = 2 * g(x)

# Prints all functions stored in memory
%show functions

# Computes the value of h(3)
h(3)

# By removing the function f, g and h are no longer valid
%delete function f
